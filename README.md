# Face System

Simple and lightweight interface for displaying minecraft player heads in chat

If you want to use this please DM me on Discord, my Discord is (asxv)


## Usage 
- Simply download and upload the **faceSystem.sk** file.
### How does it actually work?
- Uses Skript-Reflect to grab the player head image [from](https://minotar.net)
### Implementation
- I have left some uses of this system in the form of a [Discord to Minecraft linking skripat](https://github.com/asxvas/faceSystem/blob/main/link.sk) and [A custom purchase command](https://github.com/asxvas/faceSystem/blob/main/purchase.sk).
